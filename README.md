- **Todo Management**:
  - Add new todos.
  - Delete existing todos.
  - Toggle todo status between done and undone.
- **State Management**: Utilizes Redux Toolkit for efficient and scalable state management.
- **Responsive Design**: Styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern and mobile-friendly UI.
- **Routing**: Implemented with React Router for seamless navigation.
- **Icons**: Enhanced UI with React Icons for intuitive visuals.
- **Data Persistence**: Todos are stored and synced in real-time with Firebase Firestore.
